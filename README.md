## What is this?

an FP scala library for making discord bots

## Why is this?

because I didn't like any other library that could be used in scala

## Should I use this?

eh, depends. bear in mind that this might be rough around the edges, and also it's unfinished. use at your own risk.

## Will you finish it?

maybe?

## What is left to finish?

seemingly, just the types of events discord sends over the gateway and the commands you can send.
