## What is this?

a scala library for making discord bots using pure functional programming

## How to use this?

[here](https://github.com/tvoklov/discord4s/wiki/Usage-example)

## Why is this?

because I didn't like any other library that could be used in scala and wanted to write my own

## Should I use this?

this might be rough around the edges, and also kinda unfinished. use at your own risk.

## What is left to finish?

seemingly, just the types of events discord sends over the gateway and the commands you can send.
