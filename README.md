## What is this?

a library for making discord bots using scala

## Why is this?

because I didn't like any other library that could be used in scala

## Should I use this?

eh, depends. bear in mind that this is an extremely rough draft and it's unfinished. use at your own risk.

## Will you finish it?

idk, maybe?

## Why is it locked into cats-effects' IO and not using a more general effect monad?

sorry
